Instead, it said it was a \"chronic, progressive and relapsing disease that affects than 1 billion people globally in both high- and low-income countries, contributing to millions of preventable deaths.It recommended using the drugs to treat obesity for the first time, calling it a critical step toward developing a global standard of care.

Researchers from Edith Cowan University (ECU) found that cancer survivors who followed either resistance training or HIIT had reduced the growth of these breast cancer cells in vitro by 22 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. This suggests both types of exercise may help slow cancer cell growth, said Francesco Bettariga from the varsity. Although there was no major difference between the effects of RT and HIIT, \"interestingly, with HIIT, the reduction in cancer cell growth was linked to an increase in lean muscle and a decrease in body fat after 12 weeks of training, Bettariga added. The team stated that different types of exercise have different impacts on the body, with resistance training able to substantially improve muscle strength and mass, while HIIT can stimulate cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce fat mass. It s very important to find out if different types of exercise cause different effects on myokines and their potential cancer suppressive effects, Bettariga said."}

Myokines are a protein produced by muscles during exercise, which have anti-cancer effects.The team followed breast cancer survivors through a 12-week training programme to investigate how resistance training and HIIT each affect the growth of breast cancer cells in lab tests using blood samples from breast cancer survivors. The results showed that both groups of participants had higher levels of myokines at the end of the 12-week programme, than at the beginning, which means regard of the exercise you do, you can gain benefit, Bettariga said.

The stock is expected to list at a hefty 40-50 premium to the issue price, riding on overwhelming investor demand and upbeat market sentiment.By Meghna Sen September 17, 2025, 4:58:00 AM IST (Updated)3 Min Reads of Urban Company are set to debut on the BSE and NSE at 10 am today, September 17, with analysts expecting a stellar listing at a premium of 40-50 to the issue price. Strong investor demand and favourable market sentiment are driving optimism around the stock. The 1,900-crore public issue received robust subscription of 103.63 times during September 10-12. Qualified institutional buyers d 140.20 times their allotted quota, while non-institutional investors (high-net-worth individuals) d 74.04 times. Retail investors bought 39.25 times their portion, and employees d 36.79 times the reserved s. Although considered expensive from a valuation standpoint and launching in a relatively muted market environment, Urban Company's IPO witnessed strong demand. \"Given the high subscription levels and positive sentiment, we expect a strong listing gain in the range of 40-50 or even higher, depending on market trends on listing day,\" said Prashanth Tapse of Mehta Equities."}

The team of retired judges was set up last month to look into allegations that animals at Vantara were acquired unlawfully and mistreated. On Monday, it said it had found \"no foul play\" in the zoo's management. The Supreme Court had previously also said the allegations appeared unsupported, but ordered an inquiry after allegations the authorities failed to investigate the zoo properly. Vantara said the investigation had made clear \"the doubts and allegations... were without any basis\". Vantara is home to 2,000 species, including elephants, tigers and other animals. Spread over 3,500 acres, it is located in Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat, not far from Mukesh Ambani's oil refinery - which is the largest in the world.It was inaugud by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March this year and was one of the venues for its owner Anant Ambani's lavish pre-wedding events that made global headlines last year."}

Awarded the RIBA Gold Medal in 2019, he worked alongside contemporaries including Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, and Renzo Piano to define a new era of architecture focused on structure and craft rather than style. Nick was a man of invention and ideas and will be remembered for his end curiosity about how things are made and his commitment to the craft of architecture and building, the studio said in a statement. With this pragmatic creativity, Nick had an extraordinary ability to convince others that daring ideas were possible.

The work comprises a sequence of eight inter-linked geodesic domes, covering 2.2 hectares and encapsulating humid tropic and warm tempe regions. The biomes cladding panels are triple-layered pillows of ETFE foil with maximum surface area and minimum perimeter detailing. Designing the biomes was an exercise in efficiency, both of space and material, explains the team at Grimshaw."}

Credit: Stock An exotic phase of matter has been realized on a quantum processor. Matter can exist in different forms, or phases, such as liquid water or solid ice. These phases are usually understood under equilibrium conditions, where everything remains stable over time. However, nature also permits much stranger possibilities: phases that appear only when a system is pushed out of equilibrium. A new study published in Nature demonsts that quantum computers provide a powerful new tool for investigating these unusual states of matter. In contrast to ordinary phases, non-equilibrium quantum phases are defined by how they change and evolve over time, a type of behavior that cannot be explained by standard equilibrium thermodynamics. A particularly intriguing example arises in Floquet systems (quantum systems that are driven in regular, repeating cycles). This periodic driving can produce entirely new types of order that do not exist under equilibrium conditions, uncovering phenomena far beyond what conventional phases of matter allow."}

Using a 58 superconducting qubit quantum processor, the team from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Princeton University, and Google Quantum AI realized a Floquet topologically ordered state, a phase that had been theoretically proposed but never before observed. They directly imaged the characteristic directed motions at the edge and developed a novel interferometric algorithm to probe the system s underlying topological properties. This allowed them to witness the dynamical transmutation of exotic particles a hallmark that has been theoretically predicted for these exotic quantum states. Quantum computer as a laboratory Highly entangled non-equilibrium phases are notoriously hard to simulate with classical computers, said the first author Melissa Will, PhD student at the Physics Department of the TUM School of Natural Sciences. Our results show that quantum processors are not just computational devices they are powerful experimental platforms for discovering and probing entirely new states of matter. This work opens the door to a new era of quantum simulation, where quantum computers become laboratories for studying the vast and largely unexplored landscape of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter."}

The BC Ramesh-led side registered a 28-23 victory against Jaipur Pink Panthers at the SMS Indoor Stadium in Jaipur on Friday, completing a hat-trick of wins to move up to sixth place on the points table. Interacting with the media in the post-match press conference, Bengaluru Bulls head coach emphasised the importance of winning games. The feeling of winning is very important for any team. Each and every match is important for us to win. There is a lot of home support for Jaipur Pink Panthers, so it s no small feat for us to come here, put in a good performance, and beat them. Reflecting on his team s performance, the head coach added, Our defenders and raiders played well together and won us the game. We played with unity, and we re pleased with our performance today. BC Ramesh also shed light on his plans to keep the Jaipur Pink Panthers raiders at bay. He said, The main thing we had to ensure was that we sent their raiders back with empty raids as much as possible. That would give us an advantage. Secondly, we also had plans in place for Nitin Kumar to try and avoid giving him points and focus on tackling the other raiders. Even if one defender wasn t able to deal with the raiders, the others stood up to do the job."}

Please find below the previews for the PKL Season 12 matches on Monday, September 15: Despite losing their previous game, Haryana Steelers will be touted as favourites against Gujarat Giants, who have only registered one win in five matches so far. The two teams are yet to find their best form this season, and will be eager to get a win under their belt to get their campaign back on track. To add fuel to the fire, Mohammadreza Shadloui will be taking on his former side in this engaging clash. Having registered three wins on the trot, the Bengaluru Bulls will be eager to extend their winning streak when they take on the Telugu Titans. Meanwhile, Arjun Deshwal will be hoping to make his mark for the Titans once again, but he will be up against a Bengaluru Bulls unit that have been at their defensive best in recent times.

The previous editions of HIL played a pivotal role in improving the overall standards of the Indian men's hockey team, which culminated in India winning the Olympic medals in Tokyo and Paris.Considering the new edition will see women's teams too, there's hope that it will be a big boost to the national women's team, which had earlier missed out on Paris Olympic qualification.\"HIL will give opportunity for our girls to rub shoulders with the best in the world and also the coaches. Not only tactically, but the players will see how other girls and the coaches prepare. Once they start sharing the dressing room with the best, they get confidence. They will realise they are not better than us, but equally good. They will learn how to prepare themselves individually. HIL will be the highest level and a very demanding competition. If you see the (rise of) men's team, it's largely because of the previous HILs. Now it's the turn for the girls,\" Indian women's team coach Harender Singh had earlier told ESPN about the impact of the league.What about future editions of the Hockey India League?There are indications that HIL will become an annual feature."}
